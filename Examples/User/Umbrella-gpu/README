run using 
path/to/ssages Umbrella.json



run.py holds two functions - setupSimulation, which must return the state such that it is ready to run the simulation
and runSimultion, which takes the state and a number of turns to turn, and carries out the run.

You must set the ROOT variable in run.py to the directory where the engine is located
