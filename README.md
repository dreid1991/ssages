SSAGES
============

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation
The first step is to clone the repository locally.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathankwhitmer/SSAGES.git
```
**SSAGES** uses a CMake build system. It also requires the LAMMPS source code.
To compile, execute the following

```bash
$ cd SSAGES
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DLAMMPS_SRC=/path/to/lammps/src .. 
$ make
```

This will build and MPI compatible LAMMPS binary which will reside in the LAMMPS source 
directory. 

The build system will is a work in progress. 

## Build the documentation

After you have built SSAGES you can further build the documentation from the build/
directory. Make sure you have the following tools available:

* doxygen
* dot (part of the `graphViz` package)
* sphinx (`python-sphinx` or `python3-sphinx`)
* ReadTheDocs theme (`pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`)

You can build the documentation with
```bash
$ make doc
```
You can alse build the API-references and the User
Manual separately with
```bash
$ make apiref
```
and
```bash
$ make manual
```

If you have `pdflatex` installed, you can also build
a PDF file for the documentation. To compile the
API-reference into a PDF file do
```bash
$ cd doc/API-doc/latex/
$ make
```
The pdf is called refman.pdf

Similarly, you can build a PDF version of the Manual with
```bash
$ cd doc/Manual/
$ make
```
The pdf-file will be called SSAGES.pdf

### View the documentation

Once you have built the documentation you will find it
in the `doc/API-doc/` and `doc/Manual` directories. To
view the documentation in a browser call for example
```bash
$ firefox doc/API-doc/html/index.html
```
or
```bash
$ firefox doc/Manual/index.html
```
